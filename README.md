## Preface
Notice that I'm building this theme for myself and probably will not work with most of the plugins, but feel free to add issues and pull requests. I will work on them little by little.

## Retro Style
### Paper Texture

RetroNotes includes by default a paper texture, designed to enhance the note-taking experience. This feature adds a vintage feel to your digital notes, providing a comforting and nostalgic backdrop making your note-taking sessions more enjoyable and productive.

### Fonts
The fonts in RetroNotes are carefully chosen to evoke the charm of typewriters, featuring IBM Plex Mono for a nostalgic feel. This classic typewriter font is complemented by a modern twist with the use of Loew, a sans-serif font, for the titles.
This combination ensures readibility and a stylish look, balancing vintage aesthetics with contemporary design elements.

### Color Selection
RetroNotes offers a selection of carefully crafted color schemes to suit a variety of preferences and moods. Each theme provides a unique visual experience, combining aesthetics with functionality to make your note-taking sessions more enjoyable and visually appealing.
