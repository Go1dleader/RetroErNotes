## Preface
Notice that I'm building this theme for myself and probably will not work with most of the plugins, but feel free to add issues and pull requests. I will work on them little by little.
Working on:
- [x] Adding fonts
- [x] Mobile secondary colors correction
- [ ] Calendar plugin compatibility
 
## Recomended
- [Style Settings Plugin by @mgmeyers](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings). This plugin will aloud you to switch to the alternative colorschemes.
