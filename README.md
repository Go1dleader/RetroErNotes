## Preface
Notice that I'm building this theme for myself and probably will not work with most of the plugins, but feel free to add issues and pull requests. I will work on them little by little.
At this moment, this theme is intended to use the following fonts (they are not on the theme by default):
- Titles: [Loew heavy](https://www.myfonts.com/es/products/heavy-loew-143619)
- Text: [BlexMono Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/IBMPlexMono.zip). **This link will download directly the font**. Notice that the fonts you have to install are:
  - BlexMonoNerdFontMono-Regular
  - **BlexMonoNerdFontMono-Bold**
  - *BlexMonoNerdFontMono-Italic*
  - ***BlexMonoNerdFontMono-BoldItalic***
